# `radian-host` mutation record (provider selection + shared describe)

Base: `47ede1a` · one-shot worktree `/tmp/anthost-mut` (created from HEAD, deleted after) ·
each mutation run with `--no-fail-fast`; the file was restored from a copy after each and
`git status --short` was empty at the end.

| # | Requirement mutated | Mutation | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | `--provider anthropic` must use the Messages API | `Provider::from_name("anthropic")` returns `OpenAiCompatible` | ✅ caught (`anthropic_provider_sends_a_messages_request_and_shows_the_reply`: path is not `/v1/messages`) |
| M2 | the default key env switches with the provider | `Provider::default_api_key_env` for Anthropic returns `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ✅ caught (`anthropic_reads_anthropic_api_key_env_by_default_and_never_leaks_it`: the key env is not read, setup refuses) |
| M3 | `--thinking` must reach the request body | drop the `with_thinking` call in `build_model` | ✅ caught (`anthropic_thinking_modes_are_sent_in_the_body`) |
| M4 | the snapshot names the real provider | hardcode `"provider": "openai-compatible"` in `open_journal` | ✅ caught (`the_session_snapshot_names_the_real_provider`) |

The shared `describe` (item 2) is a pure text move; the two startup-text tests that pin it
are `the_startup_text_does_not_claim_credential_isolation` (agent-cli) and
`pty_the_workspace_write_notice_names_the_mcp_sandbox_gap` (radian-tui); both were run and
pass, and there is no separate behavior to mutate beyond the wording those tests already fix.
